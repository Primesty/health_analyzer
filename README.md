# Health Analyzer

This is a simple shiny dashboard to visualize health data from the iPhone's health app. 
I acquired the data using the QS Access app and turned them into a .csv file.

The main reason for this project, was to build an interface that users could use to visualize their own health data by uploading a .csv file 
themselves.
